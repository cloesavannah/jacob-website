let about = "My name is Jacob, I’m a lean, efficient and aggressive Performance Marketer based in London, with professional certifications in Google Ads and Google Analytics. I have over five years industry experience in creating and managing exceptional, growth minded Paid Ad, PPC and influencer campaigns for businesses of all shapes and sizes. Unlike most ‘growth marketers’ looking to make themselves appear as impressive as possible, whilst destroying brand value, reputation and customer LTV, I don’t create an oppressive funnel to force consumers down like sheep, leaving them feeling tricked. Instead, I create a scalable growth engine that will increase your brand value, repeat customer rate and a constant stream of red-hot prospects delighted to convert. I have devised a unique and proven methodology to create long-term, bespoke, consumer behaviour backed and results driven PPC and Paid Ads campaign which you can read about in My Methodology. My campaigns drive impressive and aggressive growth, without relying on scam tactics. I provide short term and aggressive growth that undercuts competitors, but always with long term customer retention and brand value in mind. I don’t rely on huge sales that decrease brand value, or scam tactics that leave a bad taste in the customers mouth. I don’t rely on churn and burn growth tactics. My evergreen methodology works across platforms, and continues to perform and adapt as tracking becomes evermore challenging."
